# FAKE NEWS DETECTION
<b>Abstract:</b><br>

   The proliferation of fake news in today's digital age poses a significant challenge to the credibility of information sources and the integrity of public discourse. Addressing this issue requires effective 
   detection mechanisms capable of identifying misleading or fabricated content promptly. This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using logistic regression, a widely used statistical technique for binary classification tasks.

# Procedure   
<b>Data Collection:</b><br>

 A diverse dataset comprising both genuine and fake news articles is collected from various sources. Each article is labeled as either genuine or fake to facilitate supervised learning.

<b>Feature Extraction:</b><br>

Textual features are extracted from the news articles to represent their content effectively. These features may include word frequencies, n-grams, sentiment analysis scores, and other linguistic attributes.

<b>Preprocessing:</b><br>

The collected data is preprocessed to clean and normalize the text, removing irrelevant information such as stop words, punctuation, and HTML tags. Additionally, techniques like stemming or lemmatization may be applied to further refine the text data.

<b>Model Development:</b><br>

Logistic regression is employed as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. The extracted features serve as input to the logistic regression model, which learns to distinguish between genuine and fake news articles based on their characteristics.

<b>Model Evaluation:</b><br>

The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to assess the model's generalization ability and mitigate overfitting.

<b>Optimization and Fine-tuning:</b><br>

Hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize the performance of the logistic regression model further. This may involve adjusting parameters such as regularization strength, learning rate, and feature selection methods.

<b>Deployment:</b><br> 

Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed as a web-based application or integrated into existing platforms to enable real-time fake news detection. Users can submit news articles to the system, which will then classify them as genuine or fake based on the learned patterns.


By leveraging logistic regression and advanced text processing techniques, this project aims to contribute to the development of effective solutions for combating the spread of fake news and promoting information integrity in the digital age.

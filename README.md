# FAKE NEWS DETECTION
** Abstract:**</b><br>
   The proliferation of fake news in today's digital age poses a significant challenge to the credibility of information sources and the integrity of public discourse. Addressing this issue requires effective 
   detection mechanisms capable of identifying misleading or fabricated content promptly. This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using logistic regression, a widely used statistical technique for 
   binary classification tasks.
